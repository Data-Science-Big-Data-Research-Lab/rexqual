# RExQUAL: A Tool for Evaluating XAI Techniques Based on Association Rules

# Overview

RExQUAL is an open-source tool designed for the quantitative evaluation of explainability techniques (XAI) using association rule sets. It introduces new global quality metrics for evaluating entire sets of association rules, addressing the gap where only individual rule metrics have traditionally been used. RExQUAL allows researchers and practitioners to compare different XAI methods in a standardized and objective manner.

The tool has been applied to real-world time series data in domains such as energy management and agriculture and provides a robust framework for assessing the quality of explanations generated by various XAI methods, such as SHAP, LIME, and RULEx.

# Key Features

- Global Quality Metrics: Provides a set of global evaluation metrics for association rule sets, enabling a more holistic evaluation of explainability methods.
- RExQUAL Metric: A novel metric for measuring the quality of explanations produced by XAI techniques based on association rules.
- Comparative Evaluation: Facilitates the comparison of XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME, RULEx) for time series forecasting.
- Open-Source: Fully open-source and available for customization, modification, and extension by the research community.


# Using

RExQUAL is felxible to adapt to different DL or ML models and different kind of data. The general usage of the methodology is described as follows:
1. Load and preprocess your data (folders DATA and ETL).
2. Make the predictions using a ML/DL model. Predictions must be stored in a csv/xlsx file. There are some implemented models in folder DL.
3. Apply a XAI technique. The technique must be post-hoc and provide general explanations. There are some implemented XAI techniques in folder XAI.
4. Generate association rules using the input data and the predictions (file rules.py, folder XAI).
5. Evaluate the rules in a global way. Calculate RExQUAL metric (file evaluate.py, folder XAI).

The main.py file provides a sequential workflow for the entire process, utilizing both univariate and multivariate time series examples. 
You can easily modify the script to accommodate different datasets or models. Additionally, certain steps can be skipped if, for instance, the model has already been trained or specific pre-processing steps have been completed
